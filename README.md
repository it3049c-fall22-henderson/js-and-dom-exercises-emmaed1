how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 20/20

## Self-Reflection:
I really enjoyed doing the Word Counter exercise because I got more familiar with even listeners and how they work. It was most interesting this assignment.

### How long it took you to finish this?
This assignment only took me a few hours this time. Since getting back into JavaScript, it's been easier to go through the exercises and remind myself of the commands/functions.
